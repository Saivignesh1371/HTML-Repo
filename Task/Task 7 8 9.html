    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The second aspect of beauty Emerson considers is the spiritual element. Great actions in history are often accompanied by a beautiful backdrop provided by nature. <br> The third aspect in which nature should be viewed is its value to the human intellect. <br> Nature can help to inspire people to create and invent new things. Everything in nature is a representation of a universal harmony and perfection, something greater than itself.</p>
    <p>'Nature' is an 1836 essay by the American writer and thinker Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82)</p>
