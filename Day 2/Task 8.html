    <center><h3>ABOUT THE TRIP</h3></center>
    <p>Abu Dhabi has been fast-growing and constantly adding new attractions to its already long list of World Records and unique attractions. The city is incredibly well planned with extra wide streets and smoothly flowing traffic, promising you hassle-free travel throughout the city 24/7.</p>
    <p> Summer in the UAE lasts from June to October. Until August, it is impossible to step out, as temperatures soar above 100 degrees. September and October do see a fall in temperature, and if you are willing to bear some heat, this is a good time to get a cheap hotel room in the city.

        - November to March is when the temperature is a comfortable 70 to 80 degrees and the conditions are just perfect to explore the global city. Whether it is lounging on the beach or simply visiting the top attractions in the capital, you can enjoy your vacation without any discomfort. Due to this reason, winters attract a large number of tourists to Abu Dhabi.
        
        - Therefore, in terms of weather, November to March is the best time to visit the city. But the hotel rooms are quite expensive at this time since it is the peak tourist season. If you want to save some money, you can visit during autumn – that is, from September to October, but you may have to bear with the heat and humidity.</p>
